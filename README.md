# Search Engine
This is a real time search engine that shows what people searched for the most.

## Notes
  In this project, I implemented a real-time search feature with analytics to track the most searched items. To ensure user data remains distinct, I separated visitor data by capturing the user agent, allowing for anonymous usage without mixing data.

   For background processing, I utilized Active Jobs to handle the creation and management of analytics. To support real-time scalability, I propose integrating Redis with Active Jobs for improved performance and queue management.
